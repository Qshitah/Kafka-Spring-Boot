Kafka Introduction:
Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that allows producers to send streams of events to a broker, where consumers can receive those events.

Fault Tolerance and Scalability:
Kafka is fault-tolerant, enabling you to run multiple nodes across regions, making it highly scalable.

Difference Between Kafka and RabbitMQ:
With Kafka, when messages are sent to a topic, they don’t disappear immediately. They can remain available for a few minutes, hours, days, or even indefinitely, depending on the configuration.

Kafka Connect:
Kafka Connect is primarily used for data integration. A Kafka Connect source pulls data from existing data sources into Kafka, while a Kafka sink retrieves data from Kafka topics and writes it to target systems.

Kafka Streams:
Kafka Streams is a Java API mainly used for data processing and transformation.

Kafka Topics:
In Kafka, a topic is a collection of events that is both replicated and partitioned. Imagine messages being sent to a topic. If you have multiple nodes, the data is replicated and partitioned across these nodes. Partitioning means that if no single node is large enough to store the topic in its entirety, the topic is divided across multiple nodes. There’s no strict limit on the number of messages a topic can hold, allowing multiple consumers to read from the same topic simultaneously
